## Components

### `<MercurioProvider>`

Wrap you app with the `MercurioProvider` component:

```javascript
import { MercurioProvider } from 'mercurio-lives'

const App = () => {
   return (
      <MercurioProvider 
        locale="en" 
        initialLocale="en"
        defaultMessage="Not translated"
      >
         ...
      </MercurioProvider>
   )
}
```

#### `locale` (optional)
Provides a current locale in case you don't want to use the internal context.

#### `initialLocale` (required)
Must be one of the previously configurated in babel plugin

#### `defaultMessage` (optional)
A default message in case of missing translation.

### `<Mercurio>`

The translation itself:

```javascript
import { Mercurio } from 'mercurio-lives'

const name = 'Igor'

const Header = () => {
   return (
      <Mercurio
        id="welcomeMessage"
        extra={{ name }}
      >
         Welcome, [name]
      </MercurioProvider>
   )
}
```

#### `id` (required)
The id of the translation.

#### `extra` (optional)
An object to be injected into the translated message.

#### children (optional)
The children is the default value for the ID. It'll be copied to all locales files (only on creation of the variable, don't worry, it won't mess with your translations).

### `useLocale` hook

A hook to get and set the locale:

```javascript
import { useLocale, Mercurio } from '~/components/mercurio'

const ChangeLanguageBtn = ({ setLanguage, language }) => {
   const [locale, setLocale] = useLocale()
   return (
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setLocale(locale === 'pt' ? 'en' : 'pt')}>
         <Mercurio id="changeLanguageBtn">Switch to Portuguese</Mercurio>
      </button>
   )
}
```

## Generated files

### Locales files

To edit the translations, just edit the locales files located in the `locales` folder, inside the folder specified in the Babel plugin (or in `projectRoot/mercurio/locales` if no path was specified).

### Translations file

This is a file located in the root of your Mercurio's `filesOutput` path. It's autogenerated and you shouldn't change anything in it. If you do, it'll recompile and revert what you did.
